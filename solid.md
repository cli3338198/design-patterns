# SOLID Principles

SOLID is a set of five design principles for creating maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility or job. This principle encourages creating small, focused classes that are easier to understand and maintain.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle promotes designing systems in a way that allows new functionality to be added without altering existing code. This is often achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program. Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the behavior of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. This principle suggests having several small, specific interfaces rather than a large, general-purpose one. Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not need.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages the use of dependency injection and inversion of control to decouple high-level and low-level modules.

By following these SOLID principles, developers can create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software designs.
