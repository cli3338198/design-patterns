# Design Patterns

- 23 patterns

## Creational

- different ways to create objects

## Structural

- relationships between those objects

## Behavioral

- communication/interaction between those objects

## 4 Core Principles

- encapsulation

  - have "private" values inside a class
  - create a method "setter/getter" that allows you to change that value
  - this is encapsulation, a way to prevent that value from going to an invalid state

- abstraction

  - reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details

- inheritance

  - mechanism to re-use code across classes
  - example
    - jeep > suv > car > vehicle
    - kawasaki > motorcycle > vehicle

- polymorphism

  - many forms
  - ability of class to take on many forms

## Notes

- open close principle
  - open to extension
  - closed to modification
